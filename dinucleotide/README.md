## About

These scripts were adapted from Snyder et al (2016: https://github.com/shendurelab/cfDNA/tree/master/nucleotide_composition

In the runners folder the scripts are used to find the dinucleotide context frequencies for the following
- dinucleotide_genome.sh
  - All 167bp fragments across the genome
- dinucleotide_short.sh
  - All fragments <150bp. This will only output absolute frequencies vs positional frequencies
- dinucleotide_site.sh
  - All 167bp fragments within regions specified in a bed file
